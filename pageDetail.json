It is true, the leakage of the lagoon [i.e., retention pond on the premises of Hallman, RD] was tragic and seems careless in hindsight, but the procedure was standard and legal at the time – we are talking about the 1960s where we all thought nature will miraculously take care of itself. I don’t have to tell you how many million dollars Robert [Robert Hallman, his oldest son] and I have spent on the cleanup of the site so far. You never can do and pay enough to shed the perception of the public that you are a ruthless entrepreneur, trust me. But what people tend to forget is how important my patents and the company have been at the time. We built industrial pumps that stay functional even under the enormous pressure, heat, and unfathomable radiation. There is not a single nuclear power plant in the US that does not have at least ten of our reliable pumps installed. After my retirement, I read every detail about the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. If they had installed our pumps, the disaster would not have happened. I am proud of Hallman, Inc. for its contribution to making nuclear power in the United States the safest in the world."

Of course, homeowners in Bryn Bower tend to forget how important our company was back then for stable economic growth and fret about the fact that they cannot drink their well water. Ironically, those wells get most of their power from Black Bend, the nuclear power plant 40 miles south from here – almost all its 200+ pumps were produced by Hallman 30 years ago in Bryn Bower. As much as I would like to turn back the clock and seal the lagoon properly in 1964, I cannot help but feeling that things are blown out of proportion here: There is simply no need in the 21st century to use well water in the larger Bryn Bower area, when you have city water with great quality from the nearby natural reservoirs. Sure, developers cannot cut costs anymore by using wells and septic tanks when they build new homes – as they shouldn’t! I am not belittling our mistake and responsibility but here is another tidbit: Elizabeth and I still live in the nice two-story colonial we built across the street from the factory in 1963 when Pigeon Grove was still a dirt road. Until 1991, we were using highly contaminated well water (150ppb, mind you!) until our house got connected to city water like almost every other home in Bryn East. Exafluoran is not more poisonous than rubbing alcohol and it evaporates quickly when heated. In the mid 1980s, we boiled a large pot of water with the range hood on full blast at 6 in the morning for 30 minutes. We used that water for everything from cooking and brushing our teeth. An inconvenience for sure, but not the end of the world even for our family with three teenagers. Many people who live on well water across the nation must do the same thing every day because well water quality and safety can be tricky."
