        <p>Task: </p>
        <p>Bryn Bower, a city known for its scientific infrastructure, attracted companies like Hallman Inc., a manufacturer of high-pressure pumps for nuclear power plants on the east side of town. Until 1979, Hallman legally stored wastewater on its premises in large shallow ponds (lagoons) so that the sunlight could break down its main contaminant, Exafluoran®, a chemical solvent used in many industrial processes. Hallman discontinued its use in 1980. In 1984, Exafluoran was detected in critical concentration in a well that was supposed to supply drinking water for Bryn Hill, a new subdivision. An official investigation revealed that one of the old lagoons had leaked into the ground and Exafluoran had reached the water table in high concentration around the factory, gradually spreading underground and contaminating the groundwater (the contaminated area is called “the plume”). </p>
        <p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified Exafluoran as a “probable human carcinogen” and lowered the legal limit for drinking water to 20 parts per billion (ppb) in 2001. While most Bryn Bower residents use municipal water from reservoirs, around 700 homes still rely on private wells at risk of contamination. The city is legally required to connect homes to municipal water if well contamination exceeds 20 ppb. Over 30 years, several hundred homes have been connected, and despite Hallman’s $25 million cleanup effort, the city has filed lawsuits to enforce more aggressive remediation measures and for reimbursement of the enforced expansion of the city water system. </p>
        <p>Two months ago, Hallman proposed a $15 million settlement for the city to connect all homes (approximately 400 houses) with well contamination of 3-20 ppb (as of 2020) to municipal water. In return, the city drops all pending lawsuits and takes over all of Hallman’s current and future liabilities related to the Exafluoran contamination outside the Hallman property line which roughly follows the 50 ppb contamination line. After confirming the legal feasibility and negotiations, the offer was increased to $19 million. Following a controversial public town hall meeting last week, the mayor scheduled a city council meeting for a final vote.</p>
        <p>As a city council member in Bryn Bower, you are expected to make a recommendation whether the city should accept or reject Hallman's proposal. </p>
